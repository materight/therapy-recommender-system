# Therapy Recommender System

## Get started
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/materight/therapy-recommender-system.git`.
- Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python recommender.py [dataset_path] [patient_id] [condition_id]`.

## Recommender
Ideas:
- Use matrix completion over the condition-trials pair (or only trials)
- Define a distance function and use k-nearest neighbor, then select the therapy with highest success between the k neighbor. (NB: the neighbors should have the same unsolved condition for which we are computing recommendations)
- Other info to extract and exploit: duration of trial, duration of condition, distance between diagnosed and start of trial and cured and end of trial 

## Data generation
A synthetic dataset can be generated by running the script `data_generator.py`. 

The generation can be customized with additional options (use `--help` to see the available ones).
